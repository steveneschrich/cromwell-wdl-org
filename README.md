Some notes, thoughts and potentially code snippets for using cromwell/WDL.

Every time I spend time working with cromwell/WDL, I get very enthusiastic about it. But I also see how important developing conventions for how to do things in WDL can be. Simple things, from how to organize WDL files, and tasks; to complex things like how to handle reference data. This repo is designed as a place to hold this information with the hope that structure may emerge from the chaos of my thinking.

Note that [biowdl](https://biowdl.github.io/) and the Broad Institute offer very nice starting points for thinking about cromwell/WDL. These notes are my internalization of their advice as well as adaptation for my own purposes.
